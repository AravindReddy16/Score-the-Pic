# Score-the-Pic

`Score-the-Pic` is a Python-based application that enbles the user to score images. This project leverages various Python libraries to analyze images, assess their quality, and output a score based on predefined parameters.

## Features

- **Python Powered**: Built using popular Python libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and others for image processing.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language.
- **Flask/Django (optional)**: If a web interface is provided.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AravindReddy16/Score-the-Pic.git
   cd Score-the-Pic
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/MacOS
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Running the Application**:
   Once all dependencies are installed, you can start the application. If it is a command-line tool, run the main Python script:
   ```bash
   python scorepic.py
   ```

5. **Input Images**:
   Place the images you want to evaluate in the appropriate folder (specify in code). The app will analyze and score them based on the built-in criteria.

## Usage

- **Command-Line Usage**: The application can be run from the command line by specifying the image to be scored. Example:
   ```bash
   python scorepic.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   ```

- **Web Interface (Optional)**: If a Flask/Django web interface is implemented, access the app through a browser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to interact with the application.
